# Hey! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gustavo Stefanello. I'm currently graduating in a bachelor of IT and working as a Jr. Fullstack Dev for a small software house. I'm always open to new opportunities, especially those that can help me transition into cloud or cybersecurity.

## A Bit About Me

When I'm not tinkering with code, I'm usually scribbling notes in my digital garden over at [envur.space](https://envur.space). I believe in continuous learning and strive to grow both personally and professionally every day.

## What I Bring to the Table

As a fullstack developer, I have a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, mainly working with JavaScript (Vue.js and React), Node.js, Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, MariaDB and MongoDB.

Above all, I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly software that solves real-world problems (or just some dumb and oddly specific ones). I pride myself on my attention to detail and my ability to work collaboratively with others to achieve shared goals.
